# Blockchain Security Analysis Based on Markov Decision Process
## Abstract
Blockchain is a well-designed truly distributed transaction system. Since the invention of
the blockchain system, blockchain security issues have received much attention. This paper
focus on two important attacks on bitcoin protocol: selfish mining attack and block withholding
attack. We did research on which the best attack strategy is on different computational power
of attacker. What is more, we created a new attack by dynamically combining these two attack
strategy with Markov decision process. This new attack strategy could increase the revenue of
attacker significantly, better than using one attack strategy or statically combining two attack
strategies.

## Main Idea
We created a *mixed attack* by combining selfish mining attack and blockwithholding attack dynamically. The best strategy for the mixed attack was derived using Markov Decision Process (MDP)

Here I provide an link to the [code implement of optimal selfish mining](https://github.com/nirenzang/Optimal-Selfish-Mining-Strategies-in-Bitcoin), which is useful to help you understand the concept of *optimal strategy* in blockchain attack analysis.
